# Turnkey Copilot CLI

A smart assistant that enhances your Turnkey experience with interactive guidance and insights.

## ‚ú® Why I Built This

Turnkey provides an excellent foundation for secure blockchain operations. I built this companion tool to:

1. **Enhance Understanding**: Provide intuitive explanations of Turnkey policies and configurations
2. **Accelerate Development**: Offer actionable guidance for transaction signing workflows
3. **Simplify Onboarding**: Help new users quickly master Turnkey's powerful features

This tool complements Turnkey's excellent documentation by providing interactive, context-aware assistance directly in your development workflow.

## üöÄ Features

- **Configuration Analysis**: Validates Turnkey configurations and identifies potential issues
- **Policy Validation**: Checks policy files for common mistakes and security issues
- **Transaction Request Validation**: Verifies transaction signing requests and provides next steps
- **AI-Powered Explanations**: Translates cryptic errors into clear, actionable explanations
- **Fix Suggestions**: Generates ready-to-use code snippets to fix identified issues

## üß∞ Usage

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aravind33b/turnkey-copilot.git
cd turnkey-copilot
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
